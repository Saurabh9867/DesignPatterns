A design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a recurring problem within a specific context in software design. It's not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. Rather, it's a template for solving a particular problem, which can be customized or extended to fit various situations.

Each design pattern addresses a particular design issue or problem and provides a structure of classes and objects that can help solve it. Patterns help to create code that is more flexible, modular, and easier to understand and maintain.
